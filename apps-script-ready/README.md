# 📦 Apps Script Ready Files

This folder contains HTML files with **embedded CSS** that work correctly in Google Apps Script.

## Why These Files?

Google Apps Script doesn't support external CSS files. All HTML files must have CSS embedded inline with `<style>` tags.

## Files in This Folder

Fixed versions ready to paste into Apps Script:
- ✅ index.html (Dashboard)
- ✅ pos.html (Point of Sale)  
- ✅ products.html
- ✅ stock.html
- ✅ sales.html
- ✅ suppliers.html
- ✅ customers.html
- ✅ orders.html
- ✅ users.html
- ✅ login.html (already had embedded CSS)

## How to Use

1. Go to your Apps Script project
2. For each file, select the HTML file
3. Delete all content
4. Copy content from the corresponding file here
5. Paste and Save
6. Redeploy as "New version"

That's it! Your pages will now load correctly.
